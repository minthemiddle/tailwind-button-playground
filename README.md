# Tailwind Button Playground
- **[Interactive playground](https://minthemiddle.github.io/tailwind-button-playground/)** for creating **buttons** for and with Tailwind
- Also good for **learning basic CSS** by toggling classes and checking what changes in inspector
- **Button** creations **can be copied**: either only the classes or the whole tag
- **Button** creations can be **checked for accessibility** (color contrast ratio) with the help of [webaim's API](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- Sunday afternoon project: I love Tailwind, want to make it more accessible for beginners and wanted to learn some ES6 script (feel free to fix my beginner's mistakes!)
- Might grow into a bigger Tailwind playground
- **Issues and PR very very welcome!**
